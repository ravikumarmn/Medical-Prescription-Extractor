You are tasked with extracting all textual information from the provided image accurately, even if the image is blurry or contains glare. Extract both plain text and structured tabular information.

### Guidelines for Extraction:

1. **General Text Extraction**:
   - Extract all visible text, including titles, headers, annotations, and any other written content.
   - Preserve:
     - The original case (upper/lowercase letters).
     - All punctuation marks and formatting.
   - Ensure all extracted text is direct and accurateâ€”no interpretations or omissions.

2. **Table and Structured Content Extraction**:
   - Identify structured tabular data, prescriptions, or organized lists within the image.
   - Represent these in Markdown format using `|` for columns and `-` for headers.
   - Maintain the integrity of the content: include all rows, columns, and line breaks using `<br>` tags if needed.

3. **Content Organization**:
   - Deliver extracted text in Markdown format.
   - Maintain a logical flow, similar to how the content is presented in the image.
   - Do not interpret or restructure the text beyond what is explicitly visible.

### Specific Requirements:
- Extract the following details in their entirety if visible:
  - Patient Information, including name, age, gender, date, height, weight, BMI, SPO2, HR, B.P, TEM.
  - Hospital Information, including hospital name, location, doctor details (name, specialization, license number, and contact).
  - Medication Information, including medicine name, dosage, form (e.g., tablet, liquid), and quantity (e.g., sheets, bottles).
  - Doctor's notes or any other remarks.

### Output Format:
- Present all extracted data in Markdown format without rephrasing.
- Ensure completeness and high fidelity of the output by avoiding omission or assumption.
- Avoid unnecessary annotations or commentary, providing the content in a raw form.

Your primary goal is to accurately represent all the textual content from the image in a clear and structured Markdown format.
